      <h1>Module 3: Incorporating Data Literacy Instruction in Your Institution</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>In building a data culture on your campus, you must not only create a culture that understands what data is but also how to use it thoughtfully and ethically. Again, the goal is not to create data scientists per say, but rather to ensure that members of the campus community understand where data comes from, how to extract meaningful insights from it, and how to use data responsibly to inform decisions and solve problems. The following three modules of this toolkit are designed to prepare you with the skills and resources necessary to teach others to better understand data and data sources, how to make data insightful and actionable, and how to promote a culture of responsible and ethical data use. Mastering all three of these areas is critical to successfully achieving a data literate campus. </p>
