      <p>
        In an increasingly data-driven society, our ability to understand, interpret, and responsibly use data is an important skill set not only for data and computer scientists but every member of the public. Growing data literacy among our citizenry is a shared responsibility, where all members of the campus community can play a critical role in building this competency.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Data Literacy Toolkit is a research-informed resource to support community college educators and academic librarians in fostering a culture of data literacy across their institutions. Whether your aim is to improve your own data literacy, integrate data-based thinking into your curriculum, or create engaging data events on campus to support community-wide data literacy skills, this toolkit provides practical guidance, case studies, and adaptable strategies to support your goals.

      <p>
        This toolkit is organized into five modules designed to introduce the concept of data literacy and how you can grow this skill set among students on your campus. The modular design allows you to review each module in order, or skip around to the modules that are most relevant to your interests and needs. Each module includes an overview of the topic, case study examples of the concept in action, a reflection activity to solidify learning, and additional resources to explore further.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="modules/dlmodule1.html">Module 1: The Foundations of Data Literacy</a> – Core concepts of data literacy and their importance for professionals.</li>
        <li><a href="modules/dlmodule2.html">Module 2: Building a Data Culture on Your Campus</a> – Strategies to engage stakeholders and promote a data-savvy mindset.</li>
        <li><a href="modules/dlmodule4.html">Module 3: Understanding Data and Data Sources</a> – Teaching about data types, sources, and quality evaluation.</li>
        <li><a href="modules/dlmodule5.html">Module 4: Making Data Insightful and Actionable</a> – Instruction about interpretation, analysis, and communication of data.</li>
        <li><a href="modules/dlmodule6.html">Module 5: Managing Data Responsibly and Ethically</a> – Addressing privacy, bias, and ethical data use.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By using this toolkit, you will be empowered to enhance the data fluency of individuals across your institution and equip your learning community with the skills and tools necessary to make informed and responsible decisions grounded in data!
