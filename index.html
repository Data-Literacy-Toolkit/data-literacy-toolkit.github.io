      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>In an increasingly data-driven society, our ability to understand, interpret, and responsibly use data is an important skill set not only for data and computer scientists but every member of the public. Growing data literacy among our citizenry is a shared responsibility, where all members of the campus community can play a critical role in building this competency.</p>
      <p>The Data Literacy Toolkit is a research-informed resource to support community college educators and academic librarians in fostering a culture of data literacy across their institutions...</p>
